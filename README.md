# Supply Chain Analytics
Supply chain analytics is the practice of using data and quantitative methods to analyze and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a supply chain. It involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources across the supply chain, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Linear Programming
- Task Scheduling
- Resource Allocation
- Inventory Optimization as a Flow Network
- Task Allocation
- Multi-commodity Flow Network

## Other Methods
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
- Supply Chain Contract

## Case Study
- KYY Group: optimization of product storage assignment
KYY Group is a prominent supply chain management and logistics service provider in Singapore, offering end-to-end services that include physical warehousing and distribution, system integration, and supply chain planning. Recently, KYY has built a new unit-load warehouse to provide its clients with storage services. To optimize its operations and minimize costs, KYY is seeking the most efficient and economical approach for assigning storage locations to arriving and departing products. To achieve this goal, three policies - Linear Programming Model (LPM), Static Class-based Turnover (TOS), and Dynamic Class-based Turnover (TOD) - will be applied and compared to determine the best approach for maximizing profit and minimizing labor and storage costs.
- Vasant Group: optimization of purchases to reduce food wastage
Vasant Group entered the business of integrated farming with Vasant Farm Fresh (VFF) and discovered a serious food wastage problem. The prime concern was to identify and deploy practices to reduce wastage, thereby reducing the procurement cost and achieving better business margins. To achieve this goal, we have to determine the optimal procurement quantity for the produce under two assumptions: one is assuming a one day shelf life, and the other is assuming a two day shelf life.
